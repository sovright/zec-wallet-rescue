//! Rust-side fixture for the C2 integration tests.
//!
//! Reads the harness URL and funded test seed from environment variables
//! set by `tests/regtest/setup.sh`. Each integration test calls
//! `RegtestHarness::require()` at the top; if the env vars are absent the
//! test prints a clear "harness not running" message and panics — which is
//! intentionally caught by the `#[ignore]` tag on every C2 test so default
//! `cargo test` never sees the panic.
//!
//! See `tests/regtest/README.md` for the boot procedure.
