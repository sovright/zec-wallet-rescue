//! TCP-level failover proxy for R-N16.
//!
//! Models the production scenario where a single hostname
//! (e.g. `zec.rocks:443`) resolves to a different IP between connection
//! attempts because of DNS round-robin, a load-balancer rotation, or a
//! failover event. From Argos's point of view, the `lightwalletd_url` string
//! stays the same; the TCP peer behind it is different on the retry.
//!
//! The proxy binds a `TcpListener` on a random loopback port and forwards
//! each incoming connection's bytes to one of `N` configured upstreams.
//! The selection rule is a per-connection counter: connection 1 goes to
//! `upstreams[0]`, connection 2 goes to `upstreams[1]`, and so on (saturating
//! at `upstreams[last]` for every subsequent connection). This gives the
//! test deterministic control over which backend serves the retry without
//! orchestration from the test body.
//!
//! Bytes are piped raw — no h2 parsing, no TLS termination. The proxy is
//! transparent at the wire level, so anything the upstreams accept (clear
//! HTTP/2 over loopback in our case) passes through unmodified.
//!
//! Gated on `argos-network` to match the rest of the test fixtures.

// connection, completes the gRPC negotiation, then stops responding. The
// TCP socket is still open (no FIN, no RST); the stall watchdog at
// `scan.rs::stall_watchdog` is what surfaces the failure.
//
// The proxy is one-shot: the first accepted connection drops upstream→client
// bytes after `response_bytes_before_drop` bytes have passed; subsequent
// connections are clean pass-through. That mirrors the retry-recovery
// pattern from R-N8 / R-N15 — the watchdog trips on conn #1, the retry
// loop opens conn #2 which sees clean behaviour, scan completes.
//
// The upstream side is fully drained (we keep reading from upstream even
// after dropping toward the client) so the upstream's send buffer doesn't
// block and trigger errors back through the gRPC stack — the asymmetry
// model assumes the *server* sees a happy connection.
