//! Integration tests requiring a local regtest Zcash node + lightwalletd.
//!
//! These tests are `#[ignore]` by default — CI doesn't run them because the
//! regtest harness is too heavy to boot per PR. Run locally with:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo test --workspace -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! after starting a regtest node and pointing lightwalletd at it. The
//! environment variable `ARGOS_REGTEST_LIGHTWALLETD_URL` must be set to
//! the lightwalletd endpoint (e.g. `http://localhost:9067`).
//!
//! ## What this file is
//!
//! Stubs documenting the test surface that the parallel "recovery
//! resilience" PR (this branch) defines but does not fully wire up.
//! Each stub:
//! - has a name matching the `R-*` ID from
//!   `docs/superpowers/test-plans/recovery-resilience.md`
//! - panics with `unimplemented!()` carrying a description of what the
//!   test would verify
//! - is annotated `#[ignore]` so the panic doesn't reach CI
//!
//! A follow-up "regtest harness" PR will replace each `unimplemented!()`
//! body with the actual test, using a shared `RegtestHarness` helper
//! that boots/mines/funds a known seed.
//!
//! ## Why stubs and not just a doc?
//!
//! Two reasons:
//! 1. Discoverable: `cargo test --list -- --ignored` enumerates them,
//!    so the test surface is visible from tooling rather than a doc.
//! 2. Build-checked: the test names compile, so a future rename of an
//!    underlying API surfaces as a build failure on this file rather
//!    than as silent doc drift.

// Gate the whole file behind the `argos-network` feature. Without it, Argos
// can't talk to a regtest-style local chain (validate_lightwalletd_network
// rejects the regtest chain name and Sapling activation height), so the C2
// tests are guaranteed to fail at scan-start. Compiling them out under the
// default feature set keeps `cargo test --workspace -- --ignored` clean for
// contributors who haven't booted the harness; opt in with
// `cargo test --features argos-network -- --ignored` after running the
// harness setup in tests/regtest/.

    // ## Sequence
    //
    //   1. Initial scan via the shared helper — wallet observes the
    //      harness's current tip.
    //   2. Drive a regtest reorg via zcash-cli:
    //        - `invalidateblock <hash@tip-5>` rolls the active chain back
    //          to height (tip - 6).
    //        - `generate 10` mines a strictly-longer fork, ending at
    //          (tip - 6 + 10) = tip + 4.
    //   3. Brief sleep so lightwalletd's polling loop observes the new
    //      view before Argos's next sync. The exact delay depends on
    //      lightwalletd's poll interval (~5s in the harness config); 3s
    //      is the conservative default — bump it via the test wrapper if
    //      the hands-on validation shows flakiness.
    //   4. Second scan against the same workspace. The conflict-
    //      cancellation logic (R-W24) cleans up the first session; the
    //      new session resumes from the workspace's `fully_scanned_height`
    //      and forces sync's reorg-detection path.
    //   5. Final progress must report a `synced_to_height` at least as
    //      high as the new chain tip, and the balance must be unchanged
    //      (funding tx is at ~height 201 per setup.sh, well below the
    //      5-block reorg window).

    // The strong version of "final balance matches post-reorg ground
    // truth" would put a transaction *inside* the reorged range and
    // verify Argos sees the post-reorg version, not the pre-reorg one.
    // That needs a wallet that can send funds on regtest (and therefore
    // a working spend pipeline against the harness), which is a separate
    // future PR. The current test pins the structural property: scan
    // doesn't crash on reorg + tip advances + balance below the reorg
